## How to use

> This is a starter project for creating open-source libraries for Angular. It is a full-fledged Angular workspace with
> demo application and easy library addition. It is designed to be used for open-sourcing libraries on GitHub and has
> everything you'd need ready for CI, code coverage, SSR testing, StackBlitz demo deployment and more.

1. Run `npm ci` to install everything

2. Run `npm run add [your-library-name]` to create basic file structure

3. Fill in `projects/[your-library-name]/package.json` metadata for your newly generated library

4. Add your email at [INSERT YOUR EMAIL HERE] in `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`

5. Update `LICENSE` file according to your preferences

6. Updated root `package.json` metadata to represent your project

7. Code your library and create demo for it

## Cool features

- [x] Versioning is ready for you with following simple commands:

```json
{
  "release": "standard-version",
  "release:patch": "npm run release -- --release-as patch",
  "release:minor": "npm run release -- --release-as minor",
  "release:major": "npm run release -- --release-as major",
  "publish": "npm run build:all && npm publish:all"
}
```

Just use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/) format and `CHANGELOG.md` will be
automatically generated on releases by
[Standard Version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version#standard-version).

- [x] This project has Angular Universal â€” you can easily test your library with SSR and Prerender:

  `npm run dev:ssr` or `npm run prerender`

- [x] CI and code coverage are ready, GitHub Action checks that packages build, test and lint correctly. It also sends
      test results to [Codecov](https://about.codecov.io).

- [x] Precommit checks, prettier, linter and all that jazz is there.

- [x] You can also deploy your demo to [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com) with no hustle, just use link in the
      following format:

         https://stackblitz.com/github/[User|Organization]/[Repository]/tree/main/projects/demo

- [x] You can add more libraries using the same `npm run add` command to create a whole Angular Workspace with multiple
      libraries. Versioning and publishing is configured that they are released simultaneously like Angular packages.
