## How to use

> This is a starter project for creating open-source libraries for Angular. It is a full-fledged Angular workspace with
> demo application and easy library addition. It is designed to be used for open-sourcing libraries on GitHub and has
> everything you'd need ready for CI, code coverage, SSR testing, StackBlitz demo deployment and more.

1. Run `npm ci` to install everything

2. Run `npm run add [your-library-name]` to create basic file structure

3. Fill in `projects/[your-library-name]/package.json` metadata for your newly generated library

4. Add your email at [INSERT YOUR EMAIL HERE] in `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`

5. Update `LICENSE` file according to your preferences

6. Updated root `package.json` metadata to represent your project

7. Code your library and create demo for it

## Cool features

1.  Versioning is ready for you with following simple commands:

    ```json
        "release": "standard-version",
        "release:patch": "npm run release -- --release-as patch",
        "release:minor": "npm run release -- --release-as minor",
        "release:major": "npm run release -- --release-as major",
        "publish": "npm run build:all && npm publish:all"
    ```

    Just use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/) format and `CHANGELOG.md`
    will be automatically generated on releases by
    [Standard Version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version#standard-version).

2.  This project has Angular Universal â€” you can easily test your library with SSR and Prerender:

    `npm run dev:ssr` or `npm run prerender`

3.  CI and code coverage are ready, GitHub Action checks that packages build, test and lint correctly. It also sends
    test results to [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io).

4.  Precommit checks, prettier, linter and all that jazz is there.

5.  You can also deploy your demo to [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com) with no hustle, just use link in the following
    format:

        https://stackblitz.com/github/[User|Organization]/[Repository]/tree/main/projects/demo

6.  You can add more libraries using the same `npm run add` command to create a whole Angular Workspace with multiple
    libraries. Versioning and publishing is configured that they are released simultaneously like Angular packages.

## View Engine

This starter uses Angular 9. This way your libraries will be supported across all Angular versions in Ivy world. If you
need to support older versions of Angular like 6 and above, you can use tag `view-engine` of this repository as your
starting point as it is running Angular 7.
